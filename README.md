Console Battleship game: There are two players in the game. Player 1 has  5x5 (A1-E5) = 25 spots to place their 5 ships, the same goes for player 2. At the start of the game, Every player asks to write their user name and put their 5 ship location. Any invalid location input(ex: A12, Z5) shows an error message and asks the user to input their ship location again. After the two players have done arranging their 5 ships at the valid spot it’s now the time to start a WAR. Now the application asked the user to type their shot location. Before every prompt for shot location, a 5x5 grid is displayed in the console showing the current user Shot statistics - ‘X’ is for a hit, ‘O’ is for miss. The first player to sunk all the five ships off the opponent means if the count of ‘X’ is 5 in their shot grid then the player is declared the winner and the application stops asking players for the shot location. Finally, it shows the winner name and total shot counts including miss shots to win the game.
